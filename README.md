A simple Unity game, specifically an endless running type game. 

This project has helped me learned a little about the basics of rigidbodies, collisions, C# programming, and object movement in Unity. 

### Built With

- Unity Engine (Free Version)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- None required other than the Unity App installation

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to a desired location on your computer using Git or Github Desktop
  ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ``` 
 2. Have the Unity App installed
 3. Get started by opening up the project in Unity, and feel free to mess around with the game!

## Usage

- Use this project to get familiar with Unity and its different features
- Write small-coded projects like these to show that you are actively trying to learn new things :)

## Roadmap

- My interest in game development began with a Python game that I made called E-Waste Apocalyse (feel free to check it out under my profile)
- I then decide to learn Unity with this project that I started back in the summer 2020
- From then, I have played around with some Unity and YouTube tutorials to learn more about game developement in Unity
